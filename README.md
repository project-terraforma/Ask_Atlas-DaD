Project B: Dashboards Are Dead

## Project Description

This project explores how large geospatial datasets can be more accessible through natural language interaction instead of the traditional dashboards. Instead of relying on charts or fixed queries, our project represents Overture Maps data in a structured, text-based format which are designed specifically for Large Language Models (LLMs). Our goal is to provide a text file that allows an LLM to accurately answers questions about the data and to see how the way information is formatted and explained affects how well an LLM can understand complex data and avoid hallucinations.
